I plan on building a lab to test all of this out though. For example I'd really like to know if the NE provides an update when an entry expires, or do you have to infer that based off of configuration? ",

Do you only get incremental updates and then have no idea if/when you actually have the whole picture?\r\n\r\nAs an example from my SNMP days, on boot we would first do a snmpwalk of the mac address table of a switch.  So then we know we have the whole table in our database.  Then after that we would listen to mac-change notification traps and do incremental updates.  If you were ever worried you were out of sync like if the network element reboots, you could go through that process again.\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering if in the ST ecosystem if a similar construct applies.",
