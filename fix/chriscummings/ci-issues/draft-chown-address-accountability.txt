               IPv6 Address Accountability Considerations
               draft-chown-address-accountability-latest

Abstract

   Hosts in IPv4 networks typically acquire addresses by use of DHCP,
   and retain that address and only that address while the DHCP lease
   remains valid.  In IPv6 networks, hosts may use DHCPv6, but may
   instead autoconfigure their own global address(es), and potentially
   use many privacy addresses over time.  This behaviour places an
   additional burden on network operators who require address
   accountability for their users and devices.  There has been some
   discussion of this issue on various mail lists; this text attempts to
   capture the issues to encourage further discussion.

1.  Introduction

   Administrators of IPv4 networks are used to an address accountability
   model where devices acquire a single IPv4 address using DHCP
   [RFC2131] and then use that address while the DHCP lease is valid.

   The IPv4 address may be a global address, or a private address
   [RFC1918] used in conjunction with Network Address Translation (NAT)
   [RFC2663].  The address obtained by DHCP is typically tied to a
   specific device MAC address.

   This model allows an administrator to track back an IP address to a
   user or device, in the event of some incident or fault requiring
   investigation.

   While by no means foolproof, this model, which may include use of
   DHCP option 82, is one that IPv4 network administrators are generally
   comfortable with.

   In IPv6 networks, where hosts may use SLAAC [RFC4862] and Privacy
   Addresses [RFC8191], it is quite possible that a host may use
   multiple IPv6 addresses over time, possibly changing addresses used
   frequently, or using multiple addresses concurrently.  Where privacy
   addresses are used, a host may choose to generate and start using a
   new privacy address at any time, and will also typically generate a
   new privacy address after rebooting.  Clients may use different IPv6
   addresses per application, while servers may have multiple addresses
   configured, one per service offered.

   There are many reasons why address stability is desirable, e.g., DNS
   mappings, ACLs using IP addresses, and logging.  However, such
   stability may not typically exist in IPv6 client networks,
   particularly where clients are not managed by the network provider,
   e.g., in campus 'Bring Your Own Device' (BYOD) deployments.

   It is also worth noting that in an IPv4 network, it is more difficult
   for a user to pick and use an address manually without clashing with
   an existing device on the network, while in IPv6 networks picking an
   unused address is simple to do without an address clash.

2.  Address accountability approaches

   The issue of address accountability for IPv6 networks, and thus also
   for dual-stack IPv4-IPv6 networks, is one that has been raised many
   times in various discussion fora.  This document attempts to capture
   the various solutions proposed, noting the advantages and
   disadvantages of each approach.

   At this stage of the draft's evolution, no single approach is
   recommended.  The best solution may vary depending on the scenario
   and tools available.

   The existing approaches to address accountability fall into the
   following categories.

2.1.  Switch-router polling

   By polling network switch and router devices for IPv4 Address
   Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables and IPv6 Neighbour Discovery (ND)
   tables, and correlating the results with switch port MAC tables, it
   should be possible to determine which IP addresses are in use at any
   specific point in time and which addresses are being used on which
   switch ports (and thus users or devices).

   This is the approach that has been adopted by tools such as NAV
   (https://nav.uninett.no) and Netdot (https://nav.uninett.no), and
   that will be found in many other (open source) tools.  It is
   sometimes referred to as "ND cache scraping".

   Such scraping is mentioned in [RFC9099], Section 2.6.1.4, where
   approaches to gather the data include SNMP (specifically [RFC4293]),
   streaming telemetry (where the collector subscribes to updates/
   notifications from the device) and using a command line interface
   (CLI, such as ssh).

   The downside of this approach is the load that may be placed on
   devices by frequent Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or
   other polling.  The polling frequency needs to be rapid enough to
   ensure that cached ND/ARP data on devices is not expired between
   polling intervals, i.e., the ND/ARP data should not be expired more
   frequently than the device is polled.  RFC 9099 suggests this period
   may be as low as 30 seconds.

2.2.  Record all ND traffic

   If all ND traffic observed on a link can be captured, it should be
   possible for IPv6 address usage to be recorded.  This would require
   appropriate capability on a device on any given subnet, e.g. as is
   currently achieved for RAmond (https://ramond.sourceforge.net) or
   NDPmon (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ndpmon), or a reporting
   mechanism for the subnet router, such as syslog.

   There may also be mechanisms such as a (filtered) Remote Switch Port
   Analyser (RSPAN) that may be suitable.

   A benefit of this approach is that collecting all ND traffic would
   allow additional accounting and fault detection to be undertaken,
   e.g. rogue RA detection, or DAD DoS detection.

   The downside may be the significant volume of traffic to be held, if
   a lengthy history is desired.

2.3.  Force use of DHCPv6 only

   One approach to accountability is to attempt to force devices to only
   use DHCPv6, rather than SLAAC, which would in principle give the same
   address accountability model as exists with DHCP for IPv4 today.
   [RFC4649] for DHCPv6 appears to give at least some of the
   functionality of DHCP option 82.

   While it is possible to craft IPv6 Router Advertisements that give
   hints to hosts that DHCPv6 should be used, i.e., the'M' bit is set,
   there is no obligation on the host to honour that hint.  However, if
   the Autonomous (A) flag in the Prefix Information option is unset (as
   discussed in section 5.5.3 of RFC 4862), the Prefix Information
   option should be ignored.  In such cases a user running the device
   will need to determine the on-link prefix if they wish to manually
   configure their own address.

   Not all common operating systems support DHCPv6 for host addressing,
   Android being the most notable exception.  Larger enterprises that
   are enforcing use of DHCPv6 appear to be ones running dual-stack, so
   in those scenarios clients that do not support DHCPv6 will be
   IPv4-only.

2.4.  Using 802.1X

   It is now quite common practice for research and education sites -
   university or college campuses and research organisations - to use
   802.1X for network authentication as part of the international
   eduroam [RFC7593] (https://www.eduroam.org) federated authentication
   system, as deployed at thousands of educational sites across over 70
   countries.  Use of 802.1X gives the network operator knowledge about
   their own users authenticating, but would require coordination with
   remote peers for details of visiting users admitted via eduroam.

   802.1X can also be used for wired network access control.

2.5.  Use a host-based registration protocol

   A current I-D, [I-D.ietf-dhc-addr-notification], presents a mechanism
   for hosts to opt in to registering their self-generated or
   statically-configured addresses to a DHCPv6 server.

   While it's an opt-in mechanism, it may be enough in some use cases,
   e.g., when the enterprise controls the devices that can connect to
   the network.

   There is a consideration for address lifetimes when using this
   approach.

2.6.  Using a prefix per host

   By using a prefix per host, the accountability model shifts from
   identifying address(es) used by a host, to the prefix from which it
   is using addresses, whether for itself (e.g., for containers) or for
   providing tethering.

   [RFC8273] and [RFC9663] describe approaches for devices being
   assigned a prefix rather than an address (potentially of many
   addresses) for their network connectivity.  The use of a single
   prefix per device may simplify accountability.

2.7.  Use SAVI mechanisms

   The FCFS SAVI: First-Come, First-Served Source Address Validation
   Improvement for Locally Assigned IPv6 Addresses approach could be
   used as defined in [RFC6620].

   In this case the accounting

   Discussion of appropriateness of SAVI mechanisms to be added here.
   (In principle, SAVI mechanisms work by observing NDP and DHCP
   messages, allowing bindings to be set up and recorded.)

3.  Privacy Considerations

   This draft discusses mechanisms for a site or organisation to manage
   address accountability where IPv6 has been deployed.  In most
   networks there is a requirement to be able to identify which users
   have been using which addresses or devices at a given point in time.
   This draft was written in response to requests for improved
   accountability for IPv6 traffic in university campus sites, but the
   same rationale is likely to apply elsewhere.

   While the sources of data that may be used for such purposes (e.g.,
   state on routers or switches) is generally not available to general
   users of the network, it is available to administrators of the
   network.

   The use of privacy mechanisms, e.g., RFC 8191, gives the greatest
   benefit when the addresses are being observed by external third
   parties.

   The introduction of randomised MAC addresses for devices is designed
   to be privacy-enhancing for users, whether used only in the probing
   messages when seeking to join a network, or for associating to a
   network to use it.  Such randomisation may have an impact on address
   accountability models.

4.  Conclusions

   This text is an initial draft attempting to capture the issues
   related to IPv6 address accountability models.  If an all-DHCPv6
   model is not viable, IPv6 network administrators will need to deploy
   management and monitoring tools to allow them to account for hosts
   that will have multiple IPv6 addresses that may also change rapidly
   over time.

   Some of the approaches described do not depend on a specific type of
   address management being used, and will thus work with other
   addressing methods if they emerge in the future.

   Feedback on the issues discussed here is welcomed.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no extra security consideration for this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
